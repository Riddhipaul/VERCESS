AI encompasses various technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. These technologies enable machines to understand, reason, and make decisions, leading to tasks typically requiring human intelligence being automated or enhanced. AI has applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment."

                "AI": "NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between humans and computers through natural language. NLP involves the analysis and understanding of human language, including speech and text, and aims to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. It involves tasks such as language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, information extraction, and more."
